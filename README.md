# Claude Deck

**Website**: [claudedeck.org](https://claudedeck.org)

A self-hosted web application for visualizing and managing Claude Code configuration. Provides a unified interface for managing MCP servers, plugins, slash commands, hooks, agents, permissions, usage tracking, and other Claude Code extensions.

## Features

- **Config Editor** — Browse, inspect, and edit configuration files across all scopes
- **MCP Servers** — Add, edit, test, and manage MCP server connections with OAuth support. Browse and install servers from the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io). View tools, resources, and prompts. Supports stdio, HTTP, and SSE transports
- **Slash Commands** — Browse, create, and edit custom commands (user and project scope)
- **Plugins** — Browse installed plugins with detail views and enable/disable toggles
- **Hooks** — Configure automation hooks by event type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)
- **Permissions** — Visual allow/deny rule builder for tool access control
- **Agents** — Create and manage custom agent configurations
- **Skills** — Browse installed skills and discover new ones from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)
- **Memory** — View and edit Claude Code memory files
- **Output Styles** — Configure response output formats
- **Status Line** — Customize Claude Code status line display
- **Session Transcripts** — View conversation history with full message details and tool use

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Python 3.11+ with FastAPI |
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7 |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |
| Charts | Recharts (via shadcn/ui) |
| Database | SQLite (async via SQLAlchemy + aiosqlite) |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

## Quick Start with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrirubio/claude-deck.git
cd claude-deck
docker compose up
```

This builds and starts Claude Deck at http://localhost:8000, mounting your `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json` configuration files.

> [!NOTE]
> The container mounts your home directory's Claude Code configuration. The container runs as root to access these files; adjust permissions if running as a non-root user.

## Manual Installation

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrirubio/claude-deck.git
cd claude-deck
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Development

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

This starts:
- Backend at http://localhost:8000 (API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs)
- Frontend at http://localhost:5173

## Built By

[Adrian](https://github.com/adrirubio) (13) and [Juan](https://github.com/juanrubio) during the 2025 Christmas break as a learning project — to explore open source, Claude Code, and full-stack development together.

## Acknowledgments

The session transcript viewer was inspired by and includes code adapted from [claude-code-transcripts](https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts) by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/).

The usage tracking feature ports algorithms from [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) by [ryoppippi](https://github.com/ryoppippi), including session block identification, tiered pricing, and burn rate projections.
